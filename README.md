# Project Title

Name of our website is 'GetThatDoc' which is a Notes
Sharing Platform.




## Purpose


- So nowadays the students do not the notes which
  they really need and there is no proper source from where 
  they can get notes whether its hand-written or typed.

- So we have solved this problem and made a system in which
  for eg: If I need notes of any topic I can simply search about the notes and get it. Also if I have any useful notes I can upload that notes too, which will help others.

- So the platform is mainly for the students and by the students.
